### Overview

SlideLab AI is an AI-powered microscopy platform designed to assist healthcare providers in diagnosing malaria and other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) through blood-smear image analysis. Built with EfficientNetB0 and advanced preprocessing, the system provides accurate predictions in real-time, helping bridge gaps in diagnostics, especially in resource-limited regions.

### Features

AI-assisted slide analysis: Upload a stained blood-smear image to get instant predictions.

Classifies parasitized vs. uninfected cells (currently for malaria).

Visual feedback: See uploaded cell images and predicted probabilities.

Debug mode: Inspect preprocessing ranges for transparency and reproducibility.

Scalable: Designed to include other NTDs such as filariasis and loiasis.

### Dataset Description
We used the publicly available malaria blood-smear image dataset from the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC) at the U.S. National Library of Medicine. This dataset contains thin and thick blood-smear microscopy images from both infected and uninfected patients, with expert-annotated labels identifying parasitized and healthy red blood cells. The images are anonymized and collected under real clinical conditions, making them highly representative of what diagnostic labs encounter in malaria-endemic regions. By leveraging this dataset, SlideLab AI trained and evaluated AI models to accurately classify blood-smear images, distinguishing infected cells from healthy ones and enabling reliable AI-assisted malaria diagnostics.

### Impact

SlideLab AI empowers healthcare workers by providing rapid, accurate AI diagnostics, potentially improving early detection of malaria and NTDs, especially in regions with limited laboratory resources.
